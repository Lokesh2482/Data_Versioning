1.Create a git repo and clone it in local
2.Create mycode.py and add code to it (It will sace a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3.Do a git add commit push before initializing DVC
4.pip install DVC
5.Now we do "dvc init"(creates .dvcignore,.dvc)
6.Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory, we will do this later on AWS as well)
7.Now we do "dvc remote add -d <name> S3"(COMMAND to tell DVC the remote origin)
8.next "dvc add data"(everytime a data is committed, dvc is responsible to track changes made in the data file)
Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
9.Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"(for git to keep tracking and not forget)
